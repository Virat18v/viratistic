        Programming language is an instruction to a machine that are generated and understandable by human being.
        Programming
        language designed in order to communicate with a machine so that a program can be develop to solve some problem
        and task
        that is more complex and only can be solve by a machine like computer. In addition, programming language had
        existed
        from the early 1800s years ago. There are thousands of different programming language that had been develop for
        example,
        C programming language, C++, C#, Java, HTML 5, CSS, JavaScript and Phyton.

        In this era, we can see that programming language is widely used along with the rapid development of advance
        technologies. For example, smart home, smart car and smartphone. All of this technologies…show more content…
        This will give chance to the student that master in many type of programming languages to have a wider job
        scopes in the
        future. For example, to become a game developer, student need to have a good skill and knowledge in Java and C#.
        Besides
        that, to become a Web Developer, student must have some skill in handling HTML 5 language. Therefore, those who
        master
        on several type of programming languages, can get more opportunity because they can fit into any IT position in
        the
        future. Furthermore, according to Craig Buckler (2015), most of the IT company nowadays do not hire people that
        can work
        with only one type of programming language. This is because, most of the companies have a lot of big project
        that
        require them to use multiple type of programming language in order to develop a program or software that meets
        client’s…show more content…
        Therefore, some suggestions are proposed to enhance ICT student’s skill in programming. Firstly, ICT students
        should be
        able to master more than one programming language because not all apps that had been develop by the big company
        nowadays
        use only one type of programming language. Firstly, ICT students should engage in more practical coding for many
        types
        of language. This will help them to master in many programming language, indirectly they can develop a complex
        program
        that consist of many programming languages. For instance, to develop a dynamic website, student need to use at
        least
        five programming languages including HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Servlet and JSP. This is because different language
        has
        different function.</p>
