    <p> Programming languages enable humans to interact
        with
        machines and make them perform necessary operations. Humans and machines process information differently, and
        programming languages are the key to bridging the gap between people and computers.
        1883: The first programming language was developed in 1883 when Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage worked together
        on the
        Analytical Engine, which was a primitive mechanical computer. Lovelace was able to discern the importance of
        numbers,
        realizing that they could represent more than just numerical values of things. Lovelace wrote an algorithm for
        the
        Analytical Engine, the first computer program, to compute Bernoulli numbers.
        Ada and the First Computer
        1949: Assembly language was first used as a type of computer programming language that was able to simplify
        machine code
        language, which is necessary for telling a computer what to do.
        1952: Alick Glennie developed Autocode, which some consider to be the first compiled computer programming
        language. This
        means it could be translated directly into machine code.
        1957: John Backus created FORTRAN, which is a computer programming language for working with scientific,
        mathematical,
        and statistical projects.
        John Backus
        1958: Algol was created as an algorithmic language. It was also a precursor to programming languages such as
        Java and C.
        1959: COBOL was created by Dr. Grace Murray Hopper to be a language that could operate on all types of
        computers.
        Grace Murray Hopper
        1959: John McCarthy created LISP, which is still used today. This programming language was designed for use in
        artificial intelligence research, and today, it can be used with Python and Ruby.
        The Roots of LISP
        1964: John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz developed BASIC for students without a strong background in technology
        and
        math, enabling them to still use computers.
        1970: Niklaus Wirth developed Pascal, naming it after Blaise Pascal. This language is easy to learn and was the
        main
        language used by Apple for early software development.
        The Pascal Language Page
        1972: Alan Kay, Adele Goldberg, and Dan Ingalls developed Smalltalk, which enabled computer programmers to
        change code
        quickly.
        1972: Dennis Ritchie developed C, generally regarded as the first high-level programming language. This means
        that it's
        closer to human language and less like machine code.
        The C Programming Language
        1972: Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce developed SQL for IBM. This language was used for viewing and
        changing
        data stored in databases.
        Introduction to SQL
        1978: Cleve Moler developed MATLAB for writing math programs. This language is used for research and education.
        1983: Brad Cox and Tom Love created Objective-C as the main language used for writing Apple software.
        1983: Bjarne Stroustrup created C++, which is an extension of the C programming language. This is one of the
        most used
        languages in the world.
        1987: Larry Wall developed Perl as a scripting language, used for text editing to simplify report processing.
        Script Programming With Perl
        1990: Haskell was developed as a functional computer programming language used to process complicated math
        calculations.
        1991: Guido Van Rossum developed Python, which is a simplified computer language that is easy to read.
        Welcome to Python
        1991: Microsoft developed Visual Basic, which enabled programmers to select and change specific chunks of code
        with a
        drag-and-drop process.
        1993: Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman developed R for statisticians who needed to perform data analysis.
        1995: Sun Microsystems developed Java, originally intended to be used with hand-held devices.
        What Is Java?
        1995: Rasmus Lerdorf developed PHP, mainly for Web development. PHP continues to be widely used in Web
        development
        today.
        What Is PHP?
        1995: Yukihiro Matsumoto developed Ruby as an all-purpose programming language, ideal for many programming jobs.
        Ruby is
        widely used in the development of Web applications.
        What is Ruby?
        1995: Brendan Eich developed JavaScript to enhance Web browser interactions.
        2000: Microsoft developed C# as a combination of C++ and Visual Basic. C# is similar to Java in some ways.
        What Is C#?
        2003: Martin Odersky created Scala as a programing language that combines aspects of functional programming.
        2003: James Strachan and Bob McWhirter developed Groovy as an offshoot of Java.
        2009: Google developed Go to solve issues that commonly occur with large software systems.
        2014: Apple developed Swift to replace C, C++, and Objective-C.
        Today: Computer programming languages in use today were built on the concepts designed in older languages. Many
        older
        languages are still in use today or are being used as a foundation for new languages. The newer computer
        programming
        languages often aim to simplify the work of programmers. The continual expansion of technology ensures that
        computer
        programming languages will remain an integral part of modern life for a long time to come.
